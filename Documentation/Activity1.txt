I choose to add the controller and model folders and use the .http file for testing

I asked copilot to build me a User that had an Id, first name, last name, email address and department.  
I then asked it to add in validation and make fields required and address the null string issue.

I then asked it to build my Controller for Crud operations. 
It named the file and built all the code. 

I then asked it to use best practices for the Program.cs  

I asked it to create the tests cases in the .http file

I ran into trouble because I forgot how to use the http file, but copilot and I worked together and it eventually told me to click on the "Send Request" text which worked.

All the code and tests work perfectly.
