I implemented concurrent dictionaries as that came up in the video.

I asked copilot ot analyze the project for missing validation for user input. It noted that I had already implemented annotations for Required, stringlength, and email address.
I did suggest that the UsersController be updated with some recommendations like IsvValid for the model state.  So I implemented the recommendations.  
This included a check in the createuser for duplicate email addresses.

Copilot had already included the error handling for failed dictionary lookups, but found it could improve so I let it implement those changes

I then asked if there are any performance bottlenecks.  It identified one int duplicate email check and one for ID generation.  THe id generation needs to be thread safe. 

For validation for data in Step 3, it recommends an enum for departments and trimming the data for whitesace and lowercasing the email address.  I will impelment these.

Copilot did not recommend try-catch blocks as the code is well structured and the try-catch blocks are not needed. 

FOr optimzation it recommended an Enum for Departments and that it be in a file in the models for Swagger documentation and automatic error handling.  

I had copilot write a bunch of new test cases in my UserManagementAPI.http including edge cases and error states.

I then ran the code and had a problem with the department conversion.  I asked copilot to resolve the issue
it had me update program.cs to add in an option for the jsonserializationoptions.  

I ran all the test cases and they all now work :)
